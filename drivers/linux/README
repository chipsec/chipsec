Chipsec Linux kernel module
===========================

This module was originally built on/adapted from fmem 1.5.0 and LoLA (Low Level Access) (https://code.google.com/archive/p/lola-linux/)

To install CHIPSEC framework with the kernel module, please see "Linux Installation" section of chipsec-manual.pdf
When installed, CHIPSEC framework automatically loads and unloads kernel module. 

However, if you want to manually build the kernel module, please follow instructions below.

To build driver run:
	$ make


NOTE:
You may need run apt-get install python-dev for the Python.h header (needed for switching cpu affinity). 
If you already have this in a non-standard location (i.e. any other than /usr/include/python-2.7), you can manually edit the path in drivers/linux/Makefile
