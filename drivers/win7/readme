!!                                              WARNING
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!
!! Chipsec should only be run on test systems! It should not be installed/deployed on end-user systems!
!! 
!! There are multiple reasons for that:
!! 
!! 1. Chipsec kernel drivers provide raw access to HW resources to user-mode applications
!! (like access to physical memory). This would allow malware to compromise the OS kernel.
!!
!! 2. The driver is distributed as a source code. In order to load it on OS which requires signed drivers
!! (e.g. x64 Microsoft Windows 7 and higher), you'll need to enable TestSigning mode and self-sign the
!! driver binary. Enabling TestSigning (or equivalent) mode also turns off important protection of OS kernel.
!!
!! 3. Due to the nature of access to HW resources, if any chipsec module issues incorrect access
!! to these HW resources, OS can crash/hang.
!!
!! If, for any reason, you want to production sign chipsec driver and deploy chipsec on end-user systems,
!! DON'T!

1. Build chipsec_hlpr.sys on Windows 32bit and 64bit
----------------------------------------------------

- Install WDK 7600
  You can get WDK (e.g. WDK 7600.16385.1) from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11800
- Open WDK build environment command prompt:
  "x86 Free Build Environment" or "x64 Free Build Environment" (for release build)
  "x86 Checked Build Environment" or "x64 Checked Build Environment" (for debug build)
- cd <PATH_TO_CHIPSEC>\source\drivers\win7
- build -cZg
- If build complete without errors the driver binary (chipsec_hlpr.sys) will be in source\drivers\win7\sys\i386 or source\drivers\win7\sys\amd64 directory


2. Sign driver on Windows 64bit
----------------------------------------------------

- As Administrator, run in "x64 Free Build Environment" (or "x64 Checked Build Environment"):
  makecert -r -n "CN=Chipsec" -ss ChipsecCertStore -sr LocalMachine
- cd sign
- Run "sign64_sys.bat" to sign .sys file and have CHIPSEC install the driver automatically  
- If any error/warning returned, create a new certificate store and modify "sign64_sys.bat" accordingly
- copy the signed *.sys file to source/tool/chipsec/helper/win/win7_amd64/ or source/tool/chipsec/helper/win/win7_x86/ 
- You'll need to enable loading test-signed kernel mode drivers
