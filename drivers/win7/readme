!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!
!! Chipsec should only be run on test systems! It should not be installed/deployed on end-user systems!
!! 
!! There are multiple reasons for that:
!! 
!! 1. Chipsec kernel drivers provide raw access to HW resources to user-mode applications
!! (like access to physical memory). This would allow malware to compromise the OS kernel.
!!
!! 2. The driver is distributed as a source code. In order to load it on OS which requires signed drivers
!! (e.g. x64 Microsoft Windows 7 and higher), you'll need to enable TestSigning mode and self-sign the
!! driver binary. Enabling TestSigning (or equivalent) mode also turns off important protection of OS kernel.
!!
!! 3. Due to the nature of access to HW resources, if any chipsec module issues incorrect access
!! to these HW resources, OS can crash/hang.
!!
!! If, for any reason, you want to production sign chipsec driver and deploy chipsec on end-user systems,
!! DON'T!

Build Using VS solution
=======================

1. Build CHIPSEC kernel driver
----------------------------------------------------
- Get latest Visual Studio and WDK (Tested on VS 2017 Community, should work on others).
       https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk
- Open drivers/win7/chipsec_hlpr/chipsec_hlpr.sln using VS
- Select Platform and configuration (X86 or x64, Release).
- Go to Build -> Build Solution

2. Copy the driver to CHIPSEC framework
----------------------------------------------------
Output directory depends on platform:
- On Windows x64, copy signed "drivers\win7\chipsec_hlpr\x64\Release\chipsec_hlpr.sys" to
 <CHIPSEC_ROOT_DIR>\chipsec\helper\win\win7_amd64 directory
- On Windows x86, copy "drivers\win7\chipsec_hlpr\Release\chipsec_hlpr.sys" to
 <CHIPSEC_ROOT_DIR>\chipsec\helper\win\win7_x86 directory

Old method:
===========

1. Build CHIPSEC kernel driver
----------------------------------------------------

- Install WDK 7600
  You can get WDK (e.g. WDK 7600.16385.1) from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11800
- Open WDK build environment command prompt:
  "x86 Free Build Environment" or "x64 Free Build Environment" (for release build)
  "x86 Checked Build Environment" or "x64 Checked Build Environment" (for debug build)
- cd <CHIPSEC_ROOT_DIR>\drivers\win7
- build -cZg
- If build process completed without errors, the driver binary ("chipsec_hlpr.sys") will be in <CHIPSEC_ROOT_DIR>\drivers\win7\sys\amd64 (or i386) directory


2. (Windows x64 only) Sign the driver
----------------------------------------------------

- As Administrator, run in "x64 Free Build Environment" (or "x64 Checked Build Environment"):
  makecert -r -n "CN=Chipsec" -ss ChipsecCertStore -sr LocalMachine
- cd <CHIPSEC_ROOT_DIR>\drivers\win7\sign
- Run "sign64_sys.bat" to sign "chipsec_hlpr.sys" file  
- If any error/warning returned, create a new certificate store and modify "sign64_sys.bat" accordingly
- You'll need to enable loading of test-signed kernel mode drivers (see chipsec-manual.pdf for details)

3. Copy the driver to CHIPSEC framework
----------------------------------------------------
- On Windows x64, copy signed "chipsec_hlpr.sys" to <CHIPSEC_ROOT_DIR>\chipsec\helper\win\win7_amd64 directory
- On Windows x86, copy "chipsec_hlpr.sys" to <CHIPSEC_ROOT_DIR>\chipsec\helper\win\win7_x86 directory
