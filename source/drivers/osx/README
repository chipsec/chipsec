OSX Driver for Chipsec
======================

This driver is currently in alpha release. It is not signed and you
will need to disable the System Integrity Protection to load it.

It is only compatible with x86_64 kernels, that is any release >= 10.7.

How to
------
1. (optional) Build the Driver using Xcode (chipsec.xcodeproj)
2. Turn the System Integrity Protection off: see https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection.html
3. Reboot and load the driver
   # kextutil chipsec.kext
4. Within the source/tool directory, run:
   # python chipsec_util.py spi info
   # python chipsec_util.py spi dump rom.bin
5. Unload the driver
   # kextunload -b com.google.chipsec
6. Don't forget to re enable the System Integrity Protection (see step 2)
