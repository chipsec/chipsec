TODO: Test UEFI functionality
      Fully test on 64 and 32-bit platforms 	


========================
| Chipsec linux driver |
========================

This module is built on/adapted from fmem 1.5.0 and LOLA (Low Level Access)

NOTE:
You may need run apt-get install python-dev for the Python.h header (needed for switching cpu affinity). 
If you already have this in a non-standard location (i.e. any other than /usr/include/python-2.7), you can manually edit the path in source/driver/linux/Makefile


To build:
	make

To load kernel module:
	make install
	- or -
	./run.sh

To remove kernel module:
	make uninstall
	- or -
	rmmod chipsec


TESTED ON:
	Linux 3.2.6 x32 (Mint/Ubuntu)
	Linux 2.6.32 x32 (Ubuntu)
	Fedora 20 LXDE 64bit

fmem 1.5.0

This module creates /dev/fmem device,
that can be used for dumping physical memory,
without limits of /dev/mem (1MB/1GB, depending on distribution)
  
Tested on i386 and x64, feel free to test it on 
different architectures. (and send report please)
 
Cloned from linux/drivers/char/mem.c 
(so GPL license apply)

Original name of this tool was fdump, 
which was conflict with already existing tool,
so name was changed to fmem  

Bug reports and patches welcome.

Usage:

$ make

# ./run.sh

# dd if=/dev/fmem of=... bs=1MB count=... 

-----
BUGS: if you do something like # dd if=/dev/fmem of=dump 
      dd will never stop, even if there is no more physical RAM
      on the system. This is more a feature, because Linux kernel
      don't have stable API, and detection of mapped areas can be 
      tricky on older kernels. Because primary usage for fmem is 
      memory forensic, I think it is safer to specify 
      amount of RAM by hand.
