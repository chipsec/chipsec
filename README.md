1. Description
====================================================================

CHIPSEC: Platform Security Assessment Framework

CHIPSEC is a framework for analyzing security of PC platforms including hardware, system firmware
including BIOS/UEFI and the configuration of platform components. It allows creating
security test suite, security assessment tools for various low level components and interfaces
as well as forensic capabilities for firmware

CHIPSEC can run on any of these environments:
 1. Windows (client and server)
 2. Linux
 3. UEFI Shell


NOTE: This software is for security testing purposes. Use at your own risk.


2. Installation
====================================================================

CHIPSEC supports Windows, Linux, and UEFI shell. Circumstances surrounding the  target platform may change
which of these environments is most appropriate. When running CHIPSEC as part of a corporate IT management
infrastructure, Windows may be preferred. However, sometimes it may be preferable to assess the platform
security without interfering with the normal operating system. In these instances, CHIPSEC may be run from
a bootable USB thumb drive - either a Live Linux image or a UEFI shell.


Windows
-----------------------

Supports the following client versions:
 - Windows 8 x86 and AMD64
 - Windows 7 x86 and AMD64
 - Windows XP (support discontinued)

Supports the following server versions:
 - Windows Server 2012 x86 and AMD64
 - Windows Server 2008 x86 and AMD64


1. Install Python (http://www.python.org/download/)
   - Tested on 2.7.x and Python 2.6.x
   - E.g. Python 2.7.6 (http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/)

2. Install additional packages for installed Python release (in any order)
   - (REQUIRED) pywin32: for Windows API support (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)
   - (OPTIONAL) WConio : if you need colored console output (http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/wconio.html)
   - (OPTIONAL) py2exe : if you need to build chipsec executables (http://www.py2exe.org/)
   Note: packages have to match Python platform (e.g. AMD64 package on Python AMD64) 

3. Build chipsec Windows driver (skip this step if you already have chipsec_hlpr.sys driver binary for your version of Windows)
   See instructions in <CHIPSEC_PATH>\\source\\drivers\\win7\\readme

4. Copy chipsec driver (chipsec_hlpr.sys) to proper path in CHIPSEC
   <CHIPSEC_PATH>\\source\\tool\\chipsec\\helper\\win\\win7_<platform.machine> where <platform.machine> is "x86" or "amd64"
   (Default path is <CHIPSEC_PATH>\\source\\tool\\chipsec\\helper\\win\\win7_amd64)

5. Turn off kernel driver signature checks 

   Windows 8 64-bit (with Secure Boot enabled) / Windows Server 2012 64-bit (with Secure Boot enabled):
   - In CMD shell: shutdown /r /t 0 /o
   - Navigate: Troubleshooting > Advanced Settings > Startup Options > Reboot
   - After reset choose F7 "Disable driver signature checks"
   OR
   - Disable Secure Boot in the BIOS setup screen then disable driver signature checks as in Windows 8 with Secure Boot disabled

   Windows 7 64-bit (AMD64) / Windows Server 2008 64-bit (AMD64) / Windows 8 (with Secure Boot disabled) / Windows Server 2012 (with Secure Boot disabled)):
   - Boot in Test mode (allows self-signed certificates)
     * Start CMD.EXE as Adminstrator
     * BcdEdit /set TESTSIGNING ON
     * Reboot
     If doesn't work, run these additional commands:
     * BcdEdit /set noIntegrityChecks ON
     * BcdEdit /set loadoptions DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS
   OR
   - Press F8 when booting Windows and choose "No driver signatures enforcement" option to turn off driver signature checks at all


5. Notes on loading chipsec kernel driver:
   - On Windows 7, launch CMD.EXE as Administrator
   - CHIPSEC will attempt to automatically register and start its service (load driver) or call existing if it's already started.
   - (OPTIONAL) You can manually register and start the service/driver. Follow below instructions before running CHIPSEC
     then run it with "--exists" command-line option. CHIPSEC will not attempt to start the driver but will call already running driver.

To start the service (in cmd.exe)
     
```
sc create chipsec binpath="<PATH_TO_CHIPSEC_DIR>\\chipsec\\win\\<YOUR_PLATFORM>\\chipsec_hlpr.sys" type= kernel DisplayName="Chipsec driver"
sc start chipsec
```


Then to stop/delete service: 

```
sc stop chipsec
sc delete chipsec
```
OR
* Open Device Manager
* Right click on computer name > "Add legacy hardware"
* Next > "Install the hardware that I manually select from the list (Advanced)"
* Next > Choose "System devices"
* Next > "Have Disk"
* Select chipsec.inf


UEFI shell
-----------------------

If you don't have bootable USB thumb drive with UEFI Shell yet, you need to build it:
 1. Download UDK from Tianocore http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=UDK2010 (Tested with UDK2010.SR1)
 2. Follow instructions in DuetPkg/ReadMe.txt to create a bootable USB thumb drive with UEFI Shell (DUET)
   
#### Installing CHIPSEC on bootable thumb drive with UEFI shell:
 1. Extract contents of __install__/UEFI/chipsec_uefi.7z to the DUET USB drive
   - This will create /efi/Tools directory with Python.efi and /efi/StdLib with subdirectories
 2. Copy contents of CHIPSEC (source/tool) to the DUET USB drive
 3. Reboot to the USB drive (this will load UEFI shell)
 4. Run CHIPSEC in UEFI shell
```
   fs0:
   cd source/tool
   python chipsec_main.py (or python chipsec_util.py)
```


#### Extending CHIPSEC functionality for UEFI

You don't need to read this section if you don't plan on extending native UEFI functionality for CHIPSEC.

Native functions accessing HW resources are built directly into Python UEFI port in built-in edk2 module.
If you want to add more native functionality to Python UEFI port for chipsec, you'll need to re-build Python for UEFI:

1. Check out AppPkg with Python 2.7.2 port for UEFI from SVN
   http://edk2.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/edk2/trunk/edk2
   - You'll also need to check out StdLib and StdLibPrivateInternalFiles packages from SVN
   - Alternatively download latest EADK (EDK II Application Development Kit) from
     http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=EDKII_EADK
     EADK includes AppPkg/StdLib/StdLibPrivateInternalFiles. Unfortunately, EADK Alpha 2 doesn't have Python 2.7.2 port so you'll need to check it out SVN
2. Add functionality to Python port for UEFI
   - Python 2.7.2 port for UEFI is in <UDK>\\AppPkg\\Applications\\Python
   - All chipsec related functions are in <UDK>\\AppPkg\\Applications\\Python\\Efi\\edk2module.c "#ifdef CHIPSEC"
     Asm functions are in <UDK>\\AppPkg\\Applications\\Python\\Efi\\cpu.asm
   - e.g. <UDK> is C:\\UDK2010.SR1
3. Build <UDK>/AppPkg with Python
   - Read instructions in <UDK>\\AppPkg\\ReadMe.txt and <UDK>\\AppPkg\\Applications\\Python\\PythonReadMe.txt
   - Binaries of AppPkg and Python will be in <UDK>\\Build\\AppPkg\\DEBUG_MYTOOLS\\X64\\
4. Create directories and copy Python files on DUET USB drive
   - Do not use Python binaries from python_uefi.7z, copy newly generated 
   - Read instructions in <UDK>\\AppPkg\\Applications\\Python\\PythonReadMe.txt



Linux
-----------------------

Tested on:
 - Linux 3.2.6 x32 (Mint/Ubuntu)
 - Linux 2.6.32 x32 (Ubuntu)
 - Fedora 20 LXDE 64bit

Creating a Live Linux image with CHIPSEC:

1. Download things you will need:
   - Download chipsec
   - liveusb-creator: https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/
   - desired Linux image (e.g. 64bit Fedora 20 LXDE)
2. Use liveusb-creator to image a USB stick with the desired linux image. Include as much persistent storage as possible.
3. Reboot to USB
4. Update and install necessary packages
   ```#> yum install kernel kernel-devel python python-devel gcc``` or ```# apt-get install build-essential python-dev python gcc linux-headers-$(uname -r)```
5. Copy chipsec to the USB stick

Installing CHIPSEC:

6. Build Linux driver for CHIPSEC
   - ```#> cd source/drivers/linux ```
   - ```#> make ```
7. Load CHIPSEC driver in running system
   - ```#> cd source/drivers/linux ```
   - ```#> chmod 755 run.sh ```
   - ```#> sudo ./run.sh or sudo make install```
8. Run CHIPSEC
   - ```#> cd source/tool ```
   - ```#> sudo python chipsec_main.py ``` (or ```#> sudo python chipsec_util.py```)
9. Remove CHIPSEC driver after using
   - ```#> sudo make uninstall ```




3. Usage
====================================================================

Using CHIPSEC as a standalone utility
-------------------------------------

Open elevated Windows command shell (CMD.EXE) as Administrator

- In command shell, run chipsec_main.py
 > python chipsec_main.py --help

```
USAGE: chipsec_main.py [options]
OPTIONS:
-m --module             specify module to run (example: -m common.bios)
-a --module_args        additional module arguments, format is 'arg0,arg1..'
-v --verbose            verbose mode
-l --log                output to log file

ADVANCED OPTIONS:
-p --platform           explicitly specify platform code. Should be among the supported platforms:
                        [ SNB | IVB | JKT | BYT | IVT | HSW ]
-n --no_driver          chipsec won't need kernel mode functions so don't load chipsec driver
-i --ignore_platform    run chipsec even if the platform is not recognized
-e --exists             chipsec service has already been manually installed and started (driver loaded).
-x --xml                specify filename for xml output (JUnit style).
-t --moduletype         run tests of a specific type (tag).
   --list_tags          list all the available options for -t,--moduletype
-I --import             specify additional path to load modules from
```
  Use "--no-driver" command-line option if the module you are executing does not require loading kernel mode driver
  Chipsec won't load/unload the driver and won't try to access existing driver

  Use "--exists" command-line option if you manually installed and start chipsec driver (see "install_readme" file).
  Otherwise chipsec will automatically attempt to create and start its service (load driver)
  or open existing service if it's already started

- you can also use CHIPSEC to access various hardware resources:
 > python chipsec_util.py help


Using CHIPSEC as Python package
-------------------------------

- The directory should contain file 'setup.py'.
- Install CHIPSEC into your system's site-packages directory:
  ``` # python setup.py install ```

Compiling CHIPSEC executables on Windows 
----------------------------------------

- Directories "bin/<platform>" should already contain compiled CHIPSEC binaries:
  "chipsec_main.exe", "chipsec_util.exe"
- To run all security tests run "chipsec_main.exe" from "bin" directory:
  ``` # chipsec_main.exe ```
- To access hardware resources run "chipsec_util.exe" from "bin" directory:
  ``` # chipsec_util.exe ```

If directory "bin" doesn't exist, then you can compile CHIPSEC executables:

- Install "py2exe" package from http://www.py2exe.org
- From root chipsec directory run "build_exe_<platform>.py" as follows:
  ``` # python build_exe_<platform>.py py2exe ```
- chipsec_main.exe, chipsec_util.exe executables and required libraries will be created in "bin/<platform>" directory

5. CHIPSEC Extension Modules and API
====================================================================

In the most basic sense, a platform module is just a python script with a top-level function called check_all().
These modules are stored under the chipsec installation directory in a subdirectory "modules".
The "modules" directory contains one subdirectory for each chipset that chipsec supports.
Internally the chipsec application uses the concept of a module name, which is a string of the form:

'common.bios_wp'

This means module 'common.bios_wp' is a python script called "bios_wp.py" that is stored at "<ROOT_DIR>\\chipsec\\modules\\common\\".

Writing Your Own Platform Modules (security checks)
---------------------------------------------------

- Implement a function called check_all() in your module
  o Use other chipsec components for support
  o See 'CHIPSEC Components/API' section

- Copy your module into the "chipsec/modules/" directory structure 
  o Modules specific to certain chipset should be in "chipsec/modules/<chipset_code>" directory 
  o Modules common to all supported chipsets should be in "chipsec/modules/common" directory

- If a new chipset needs to be added: 
  o Create directory for the new chipset in "chipsec/modules"
  o Create empty "__init__.py" in new directory
  o Modify "chipsec/chipset.py" to include detection for the chipset you are adding

Using Chipsec in a Python Shell
-------------------------------

The chipsec.app component can also be run from a python interactive shell or used in other python scripts.
The chipsec.app module contains application logic in the form of a set of python functions for this purpose: 

- run_module('module_path')
  Immediately calls module.check_all() and returns.  Does not affect internal loaded modules list. 

- load_module('module_path')
  Loads a module into the internal module list for batch processing 

- unload_module('module_path')
  Unloads a module from the internal module list

- load_my_modules()
  Loads all modules from "modules\\common" and (if the current chipset is recognized)
  "modules\\<chipset_code>" into an internal list for batch processing.

- run_loaded_modules()
  Calls the check_all() function from every module in the internal loaded modules list

- clear_loaded_modules()
  Empties the internal loaded module list

- run_all_checks()
  Calls load_my_modules() followed by run_loaded_modules()
  This function executes all existing security checks for a given chipset/platform.
  Calling this function in Python shell is equivalent to executing standalone "chipsec_main.py" or "chipsec_main.exe"

Example:
```
import chipsec_main         
chipsec_main._cs.init(True) # if chipsec driver is not running
chipsec_main.load_module('chipsec/modules/common/bios_wp.py')
chipsec_main.run_loaded_modules()
```
