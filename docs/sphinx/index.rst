CHIPSEC
=======

CHIPSEC is a framework for analyzing platform level security of
hardware, devices, system firmware, low-level protection mechanisms, and
the configuration of various platform components.

It contains a set of modules, including simple tests for hardware
protections and correct configuration, tests for vulnerabilities in
firmware and platform components, security assessment and fuzzing tools
for various platform devices and interfaces, and tools acquiring
critical firmware and device artifacts.

CHIPSEC can run on *Windows*, *Linux*, *Mac OS* and *UEFI shell*. Mac OS
support is Beta.

.. warning::

   Chipsec should only be used on test systems! 

   It should not be installed/deployed on production end-user systems.

   There are multiple reasons for that:

   1. Chipsec kernel drivers provide direct access to hardware resources to
   user-mode applications (for example, access to physical memory). When installed on
   production systems this could allow malware to access privileged hardware resources.

   2. The driver is distributed as source code. In order to load it on Operating System
   which requires kernel drivers to be signed (for example, 64 bit versions of
   Microsoft Windows 7 and higher), it is necessary to enable TestSigning (or equivalent)
   mode and sign the driver executable with test signature. Enabling TestSigning
   (or equivalent) mode turns off an important OS kernel protection and should not be done
   on production systems.

   3. Due to the nature of access to hardware, if any chipsec module issues incorrect access
   to hardware resources, Operating System can hang or panic.

Installation
------------

CHIPSEC supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, DAL and UEFI shell.
Circumstances surrounding the target platform may change which of these
environments is most appropriate.

Using CHIPSEC
-------------

CHIPSEC should be launched as Administrator/root

CHIPSEC will automatically attempt to create and start its service,
including load its kernel-mode driver. If CHIPSEC service is already
running then it will attempt to connect to the existing service.

Use ``--no-driver`` command-line option to skip loading the kernel
module. This option will only work for certain commands or modules.
