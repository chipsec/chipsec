Installation
============
CHIPSEC supports Windows, Linux, and UEFI shell. Circumstances surrounding the target platform may change which of these environments is most appropriate. 
When running CHIPSEC on client PC systems, Windows may be preferred. However, sometimes it may be preferable 
to assess platform security without interfering with the normal operating system. 
In these instances, CHIPSEC may be run from a bootable USB thumb drive - either a Live Linux image or a UEFI shell.
