This module checks that SPD Write Disable bit in SMBus controller has been set

References:

This module checks the following:

    SMBUS_HCFG.SPD_WD

The module returns the following results:

    PASSED : SMBUS_HCFG.SPD_WD is set

    FAILED : SMBUS_HCFG.SPD_WD is not set and SPDs were detected

    INFORMATION: SMBUS_HCFG.SPD_WD is not set, but no SPDs were detected

Hardware registers used:

    SMBUS_HCFG
