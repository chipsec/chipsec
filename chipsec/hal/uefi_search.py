# - EFI binaries are searched according to criteria defined by "match" rules.
# - EFI binaries matching exclusion criteria defined by "exclude" rules are excluded from matching.
#
# Format of the matching rules (any field can be empty or missing):
# - Individual rules are OR'ed
# - criteria within a given rule are AND'ed
#
# Example:
#
#  "UEFI_rootkitX": {
#    "description": "yet another UEFI implant X",
#    "match": {
#      "rktX_rule1" : { "guid": "12345678-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX" },
#      "rktX_rule2" : { "name": "rootkitX.efi" }
#    }
#  }
#
# Above UEFI_rootkitX example results in a match if the following EFI binary is found:
# - with GUID "12345678-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
# OR
# - with Name "rootkitX.efi"
#
#
#  "UEFI_vulnerabilityX": {
#    "description": "yet another UEFI vulnerability X",

#      "vulnX_rule2": { "md5": "aabbccddeeffgghhiijjkkllmmnnoopp", "sha1": "aabbccddeeffgghhiijjkkllmmnnooppqqrrsstt" }
#    },
#    "exclude": {
#      "vulnX_patched": { "md5": "HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH", "sha1": "HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" }
#    }
#  }
#
# Above UEFI_vulnerabilityX example results in a match if the following EFI binary is found:
# - with GUID "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX" AND contains a byte sequence matching regular expression "IAMVULNERABLE"
# OR
# - with MD5 hash "aabbccddeeffgghhiijjkkllmmnnoopp" AND SHA-1 hash "aabbccddeeffgghhiijjkkllmmnnooppqqrrsstt"
# Unless it's a EFI binary:
# - with MD5 hash "HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" AND SHA-1 hash "HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"

#     }
#   }
#
# Above UEFI_vulnerabilityY example results in a match if the following EFI binary is found:
